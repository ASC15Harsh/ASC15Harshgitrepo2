// Runtime Polymorphism is demonstrated here as the appropriate method (showDetails()) is called based on the actual object type (whether it's a Movie, SpecialMovie, or InternationalMovie), not the reference type (which is Movie in all cases).
// The showDetails() method is defined in the parent class (Movie) and overridden in the subclasses (SpecialMovie and InternationalMovie), enabling each class to provide its own specific implementation of showDetails(). This behavior allows for more flexible and maintainable code.
